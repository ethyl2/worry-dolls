# Virtual Worry Dolls

When I was young, I was quite a worrier -- and still am, actually. Anyway, my parents gave me a set of worry dolls to see if they would help me.

There has been a lot of focus on mental health lately, and I wanted to create an app that could help fellow worriers.

I hope to be able to make this a place where people can smile, journal a bit about their worries, and leave the site feeling a little lighter.

Contributions greatly welcomed!

## Deployment

https://ethyl2.github.io/worry-dolls/

## Getting Started

Fork or clone this project.
If you use VS Code, you can click on index.html in the left navigation and select 'Open with live server'.

## TODO:

- Make worry doll assets
- Page designs
- Functionality to tell a different worry to each doll.
- Save the worries in something more permanent than session storage.
- An animation of putting a pillow on top of the dolls when the user is done telling their worries.
- List of mental health resources, in case users could use more help.
- Any other ideas?
