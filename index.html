    <p class="text-2xl leading-loose pt-6">Read the fascinating history of Worry Dolls <span class="italic">(Muñeca
        quitapena)</span>tiny, hand-made dolls <br />The History dates back to the Mayan Culture.</p>
    <p>The Mayan legend tells (according to the Mayan sacred book the Popol Vuh) that when their gods met to form the
      Mayan world, their attempt to create humanity was fruitless.</p>
    <p>"The first men were formed of stone, but they were so hard that they could not move"</p>
    <p>"In the second attempt they tried it with mud, but with the first rain the men fell apart."</p>
    <p>The Mayan story goes on to say that their gods agreed: "May they be made of corn!" And so it was that Ixmucané
      emerged, the goddess of that grain of corn.She was in charge of creating Mayan men and women.</p>
    <p>Post-Mayan culture folklore says that after a while, the Corn Goddess Ixmucané transformed to reincarnate into
      doll rocks to protect the corn men and women that she helped create.</p>
    <p That is why it is said that little dolls have the power to solve problems and concerns.</p>

    <p class="text-2xl leading-loose">The Use of Worry Dolls</p>
    <p> The classic way of using them, is children putting them under their pillow at night, to take their worries away.
    </p>
    <p> The purpose of these dolls is to help children of all ages with their worries by expressing themselves out loud.
      It's believed that for the worry dolls to work their magic, after the child has confessed their worries, they have
      to put the worry dolls under their pillow and go to sleep. In the morning all of their worries will be gone. </p>
